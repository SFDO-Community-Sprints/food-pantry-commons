# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
An Impact Labs project started started with outlining all of the different general use cases for Food Pantries and drafting process flows and data models. Sprint contributers are documenting a recommended solution design for these use cases that organizations could use to build out their own customizations in Salesforce. We envision this being potentially built into some installable form in the future after further refinement and piloting by target organizations.
